    "### <font color = \"yellow\" >Objective:</font>\n",
    "This project aims to build a sentiment analysis tool to classify customer reviews of Amazon devices as positive, negative, or neutral. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The project involves preprocessing review text, extracting key features, and implementing both traditional machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, ...) and deep learning models (LSTM-based RNNs). After training and evaluating these models, the project will compare their performance to select the most effective one for deployment in the sentiment analysis tool. This approach ensures that the tool utilizes the best-performing model to deliver accurate sentiment classification, ultimately supporting better business decisions and product improvements.\n",

Currently, I have 2 mini blinks ... which work the best - if they are plugged in. Currently, one is missing, and the other is often unplugged because it is annoying if someone is working in the backyard. We have 2 doorbells. One never seems to be working, but the front door at least rings through. I rarely get pictures from it anymore.\n",

It&apos;s been ages since the white storage box quit working, and I can&apos;t find the replacement. My husband says he&apos;ll get around to installing the second spotlights, but he&apos;s been saying that for 2 years now.\n",

When it works, it&apos;s nice ... though it is always delayed, so we never get faces or actions ... frequently it records backs as people leave or nothing at all, as the person has already gone.\n",

Currently, I have 2 mini blinks ... which work the best - if they are plugged in. Currently, one is missing, and the other is often unplugged because it is annoying if someone is working in the backyard. We have 2 doorbells. One never seems to be working, but the front door at least rings through. I rarely get pictures from it anymore.\n",

It&apos;s been ages since the white storage box quit working, and I can&apos;t find the replacement. My husband says he&apos;ll get around to installing the second spotlights, but he&apos;s been saying that for 2 years now.\n",

Super frustrated with the hidden costs and unreliability. When it works, it&apos;s nice ... though it is always delayed, so we never get faces or actions ... frequently it records backs as people leave or nothing at all, as the person has already gone.\n",

    "- Lemmatization reduces words to their dictionary base form by using vocabulary and part-of-speech (POS) tagging.
